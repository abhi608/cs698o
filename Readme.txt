We have iterated over a lot of values of Batch size and learning rate. Accuracy corresponding to a lot of these have been listed in assignment_1_2.ipynb in the 3rd box from top

We couldn't do so for assignment_1_1 due to lack of computing resources. However, some iterations were done and the current batch size and learning rate gave the best accuracy aong them.

Also, use of gpu for training and cpu for testing was tried to allow larger batch sizes.
